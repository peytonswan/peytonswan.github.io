  	<center><p>Summary of Omelas</span></center>
	  <ul>
	     <li>How can I tell you about the people of Omelas? A city of everything you could ever imagine. Endless sex, drugs, a true city of joy some might say. All citizens of Omelas experience this perfect world, well, all but one.  As all things in life have a price, the price of Omelas social harmony and happiness comes at the expense of a child, who is forced into solitary confinement in a basement. Everyone knows of this child, but helping the child would destroy all things good about Omelas, so they are left with two choices: let the child suffer, or to leave Omelas. Those who walk away from Omelas travel to a place that is unknown to mankind, a place that is indescribable, however, it is a place where you will not have to let a child suffer to be happy.
        Now I ask again, how can I tell you about the people of Omelas? Are they selfish to let someone else suffer to benefit themselves, or are they just doing what’s right for the greater good of the city?

    	<center><p>Thesis' (5)</span></center>
	   <ul>
	      <li>The city of Omelas, one of happiness and societal harmony, is right in sacrificing the life of a child in order to honor the terms in which Omelas has agreed to. All things in life have a price, and the benefits that the citizens obtain through the sacrifice of one child makes the price worth it, and ethically just.</li>
	      <li>The citizens of Omelas are unjust in sacrificing a child's life in order to benefit themselves. For a city that is meant to be a fairy-tale like, and the perfect world for all who live, it is unfair to take that away from one person. A citizen can’t possibly be able to live with the fact that they can save a child from eternal suffering, but they are actively choosing not to do a thing about it.</li>
	      <li>Although the citizens of Omelas are actively sacrificing the life of a child, there is nothing they can do about it. They do have the ability to care for the child and attempt to show the child some type of care, but according to the rules of Omelas, helping this child may be beneficial for that child in the short-term, you are sacrificing all the things that make Omelas the joyous city it is. The citizens are in a lose-lose situation, and the best course of action is to let only one human suffer, so then not all humans must suffer.</li>
	      <li><b>The citizens of Omelas are left with what seems like an ethically challenging choice, but it is quite simple. With the provided information from the reading, we don’t know for sure whether or not helping the child actually destroys all the things that make Omelas the fairy-tale-like city it is. With this lack of information, why not take that risk? The citizens of Omelas are told that the child “has” to be there, but why? What if the child is suffering for no reason, and the citizens could have done something about it a long time ago? All of these uncertainties surrounding the suffering of the child leads me to believe that against all warning signs and all the lore behind the child, the ethically correct course of action is to help the child.</b></li>
	      <li>Those who leave the city of Omelas are making the ethically correct decision. Because of the social structure of Omelas, you would never be able to help care for the child, as there will definitely be consequences for doing such a thing, but living at the expense of someone's suffering is unjust. So, to compromise, or meet in the middle of both choices, the best course of action is to leave all together. Although you can’t end the suffering of the child, you aren’t reaping the “benefits” for your own personal gain. You aren’t a part of the problem, so it isn't your problem.</li>
