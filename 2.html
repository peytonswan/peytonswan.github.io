        <h1>The Big Change: How Meta Got Called Out and What It Means for Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Recently, Meta (the company behind Facebook) had to make a big change because the government said they weren't being fair with their ads. This was a big deal because it's the first time a company had to change its computer program (algorithm) to make sure it's fair to everyone, no matter their race, religion, or where they come from.
           
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>1. Meta was using a computer program that wasn't fair, deciding who sees housing ads based on personal things like race or religion. That's not allowed.</p>
            <br>   
            <p>2. They had this "Special Ad Audience" tool that wasn't playing fair. It made us wonder: Can computer programs be made to treat everyone equally?</p>
            <br>   
            <p>3. Meta has to fix its ad system now, and people will check to ensure it does. This is new, and it's a big deal. How will they make sure everything is fair now?</p>
            <br>               
            <p>4. What does this mean for us, the users? It shows that people are starting to take action to make sure technology treats everyone fairly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>5. And for us, as students, what can we learn? We're the next ones up. We can make technology better and fairer for everyone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>6. There's going to be someone watching over Meta's shoulder (court and a third-party reviewer) to keep them honest. Will having someone watch them really make things better?</p>
            <br>    
            <p>7. If Meta doesn't make things right, they could be in more trouble. But what will make other companies pay attention and act fairly too?</p>
            <br>   
            <p>8. This isn't just about Meta. It's about all tech companies and how they use their power. How can all companies be made to use their power fairly?</p>
        <br>
